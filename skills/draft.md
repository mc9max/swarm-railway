When to use: write an email, LinkedIn note, or in-app message in the user's voice, but do not send it.

Inputs: audience, goal, and any facts after the command.

Steps:
1. Research only if facts are missing (tavily_search / exa_search). Cite what you used.
2. Draft 1 short version and 1 longer version.
3. Write `drafts/<slug>.md` in the workspace.
4. Call request_approval with action "send outreach" before anyone hits send.

Output: both drafts + the workspace path. Never claim it was sent.

Approval: required before send, enroll, or publish.
